- Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): mentorship, emotional intelligence, intuitive learning

TEXT FORMATTING RULES:
- Avoid using forward slashes in text (e.g., write "on Reddit" instead of "r/dotnet on Reddit")
- Use full words instead of abbreviations with slashes
- Escape special characters properly in JSON
- Keep text clean and readable without technical symbols in descriptions
